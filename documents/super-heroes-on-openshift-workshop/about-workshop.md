# About Workshop

This workshop offers attendees an intro to mid-level, hands-on session with **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform** - a certified enterprise Kubernetes platform for modern cloud-native application, from containerizing microservices, to deploying an entire application, to execute microservices and consuming them as well tracing, monitoring, and management.

What are we going to deploy to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is going to be a set of microservices that:

:white_check_mark: Developed with Quarkus (the microservices are already developed, and you don’t need to know Quarkus :thumbsup:)

:white_check_mark: Exposing HTTP APIs

:white_check_mark: Exchanging events with Apache Kafka

:white_check_mark: Storing data in databases

:white_check_mark: With some parts of the dark side of microservices (resilience, health, monitoring) :scream:

:white_check_mark: Answer the ultimate question: are super-heroes stronger than super-villains? :confused:

This workshop is a BYOL *(Bring Your Own Laptop)* session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop, and be ready to install a few set of tools. What you are going to learn:

:pushpin: How to deploy microservices to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

:pushpin: How to create application supported services in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Database, Kafka, Service Registry)

:pushpin: How to improve the resilience of our microservices

:pushpin: How to monitor your application in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

## Presenting the Workshop

This workshop should give you a practical introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You will practice all the needed tools to deploy an entire microservice architecture, mixing classical HTTP, reactive and event-based microservices. You will finish by monitoring and scaling the microservices so they can handle the load.

The idea is that you leave this workshop with a good understanding (*or at least, better!*) of what Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is and what's not, and how it can help you in your projects. Then, you’ll be prepared to investigate a bit more on your own.

## Notice

**This workshop expects that:**

1. You have a computer (or maybe tablet) that have a modern web browser installed e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge.

2. You understand what container is and how it works as well as its ecosystem such as Dockerfile, container image, container storage and network etc.

3. You know basic concept of what Kubernetes is and how it works.

4. You have basic understanding of Kubernetes objects or resources like Pod, Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, Label, Annotation etc. (you don't need to know everything but the basic ones).

**This workshop won't:**

1. Be suitable for people who have never use or know about Kubernetes before.

2. Ask you to code any programming language.

3. Explain basic concept of Kubernetes e.g. its arcuitecture and components, what each object or resource is, and how it works.

4. Tell you what every single line of code, command, or statement is (this is hands-on workshop not tutorial session :wink:). But we'll tell you what it does and what for.

If you're new to Kubernetes, have a look at this useful [resources](../appendix/useful-resources.md).
